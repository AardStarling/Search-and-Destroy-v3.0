# Statement on being banned - 4 Jan 2019

The **exact** sequence of events relating to my being banned are as follows:

1. Lasher replies to one of my notes on ideas, saying "Yet another reason your channel ban is never being lifted."
2. I reply to his note with "You could have talked to me directly, instead you choose to do this." or similar.  
3. Lasher send me a tell, saying "you are a cancer on this game" among other things.
4. Lasher removes his 'reply' pointer so I am unable to respond to his tell.  He also removes my note privileges, so I'm unable to contact him via personal either.
5. Upset, I ftalk "hey asshole, maybe I should add GQUEST to S&D".
6. Lasher sent me a tell "I knew you would threaten to add gquest to it sooner or later.  I will find someone else to host it.  Goodbye" and banned me immediately after.

All of these happened *before* I was bannedâ€”**not** after!  

- *After* being banned, I sent Lasher several angry emails.  **No** I didn't get banned for sending them, because I was already banned for my comment on ftalk!
- *After* being banned, I added gquest to S&D and it is available (See S&D v3.0).  

Look at Abelinc's logs for December 15, 2018, immtalk channel and you can see that Lasher makes it sound like I got banned for harassing him via email.  **I didn't.**  I got banned for an off-the-cuff remark on ftalk and *that is all*.  Is it any wonder I was pissed off?  Are you OK with Lasher deliberately pushing a player's buttons to upset them, and then lying by omission by telling an edited version of the story?  Really???
