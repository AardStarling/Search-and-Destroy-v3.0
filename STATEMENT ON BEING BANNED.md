# Statement on being banned - 4 Jan 2019

The **exact** sequence of events relating to my being banned are as follows:

1. Lasher replies to one of my notes on ideas, saying "Yet another reason your channel ban is never being lifted."
2. I reply to his note with "You could have talked to me directly, instead you choose to do this." or similar.  
3. Lasher send me a tell, saying "you are a cancer on this game" among other things.
4. Lasher removes his 'reply' pointer so I am unable to respond to his tell.  He also removes my note privileges, so I'm unable to contact him via personal either.
5. Upset, I ftalk "hey asshole, maybe I should add GQUEST to S&D".
6. Lasher sent me a tell "I knew you would threaten to add gquest to it sooner or later.  I will find someone else to host it.  Goodbye."
7. Seconds later, I was banned.

All of the above happened *before* I was banned—**not** after!  

- *After* being banned, I sent Lasher several nasty, angry emails.  **No** I didn't get banned for sending them, because I was already banned for my comment on ftalk!
- *After* being banned, I added gquest to S&D and it is available (See S&D v3.0).  

Look at Abelinc's logs for December 15, 2018, immtalk channel and you can see that Lasher makes it sound as if I got banned for harassing him via email.  **I didn't.**  I got banned for an off-the-cuff remark on ftalk and *that is all*.  Yes I sent him some nasty emails, and yes I called him names—*after* I was banned, ffs it had already been a miserable, shitty holiday season.  No, I shouldn't have done it, but is it any wonder I was pissed off?  How would you feel?

So let's get this straight:
- Lasher deliberately pushed my buttons with his unconstructive ideas note and insulting tell.
- Lasher wouldn't let me reply via tell or note, which shows he had no interest in being constructive or resolving anything at all.
- Lasher banned me for making an ftalk comment.
- Lasher essentially lied ("strongly implied") that I was banned *after* and *because of* sending nasty email—when actually, I wasn't!

If you are actually OK with Lasher deliberately harassing a contributor to his game knowing it will upset them, banning them when they become upset, and then lying to the community about the reasons, I don't know what to tell you.

Based on the facts of what happened, I should not have been banned because nothing I did rises to that level.  If my ban were truly justified, Lasher would be able to explain it clearly and be done with it.  He wouldn't need to leave anything out or claim it was because of something else, but that is exactly what he did.  Why would I have sent him nasty emails before being banned, anyway?  Lasher wants you to believe he's the victim here, but in view of his actions before the ban and his dishonesty after, the truth is **he's not**.
