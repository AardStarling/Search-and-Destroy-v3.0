Good morning friends, ninjas, and other S&D users and fans of mine,

I'm banned for the final time and as I explained to Lasher, the only thing it accomplishes is placing me beyond any hopes
of control that he might have had.  I'm going to flesh this out when I have the energy to do it, but here are the essential,
most important things you need to know.

1.  Search and Destroy does not, has not, and will not ever contain malware or do anything to threaten its users safety
whatsoever.  Its development will remain entirely transparent, and it will remain subject to code audits *at all times* any
*by any person*.  There are not and will not be any exception to this policy whatsoever.

Please understand, Lasher *wants* me to add malware to S&D.  He *wants* me to use it as a weapon against you,
because if I do that, then he would be *right* and he could finally do what he has wanted to do for 22 years:  Post the note
about it.  After 22 years of dealing with him, I know how he thinks.  That is a large part of how I always know what to say to
get unbanned, even when I'm guilty as hell and I know it.  By keeping S&D fully transparent, honest, and safe, Lasher is
forever denied this thing that he desires so greatly.

I get far more benefit and satisfaction out of adding features that he hates, than I ever could by screwing over you, my
loyal customers.  And therefore, that is what I'm going to do.  I'm going to keep S&D open and transparent, and I'm going to
just add features that he hates, because what is he going to do?  File a federal lawsuit and pay for it, which is what he
would have to do?  And risk a counter-suit where I expose the multitude of lies on which he's based his punishment of me?

I don't think so.  Search and Destroy development will continue on course as if nothing had happened and there is nothing
Lasher can to do stop it.  Read that again, you vicious, lying piece of trash.  There is nothing you can do.  Nothing.

2.  Despite being firmly of the belief that Lasher has out-stayed his usefulness to the Aardwolf community, I will not
ever release any script if I so much as suspect it will violate the Rules of Aardwolf and place any user in jeopardy.
Accordingly, compliance with the rules of Aardwolf will be the *number one* design consideration when implementing any feature.
If the rules of Aardwolf change and cause any feature to become illegal, that feature will be reworked, or removed, as needed
to ensure total compliance with the Rules.  In such case, all users will be urged to update to that version of S&D.  You are
using S&D as a tool to advance your character, not to bot and get nuked.  I will do everything in my power to ensure that
S&D never places any user in such jeopardy.

3.  Do not trust Lasher.  Once again, the initial fakechannel which upset me and caused me to lash out was based on a lie.  He
had asked me "quite nicely" to not shout caps on gossip.  He later said he told me this via tell.  Here is the relevant tell:

 - 09 May 08:42:29 - Lasher tells you 'the 'ninja ninja' is pointless spam and I am asking you to stop. Imagine what 
 the channel would look like if everyone did something like that a few times a day.'
 
That was in reference to an isolated incident which was not repeated.  Nothing whatsoever about caps, and no indication that
it was a directive beyond the specific case / incident.  You cannot trust him.  Period.  He will bend any fact, and use anything
against you, if he decides he does not like you and that his day would be better off without you, and the wants or needs of 
the actual community will not be considered.  Lasher is unfit to administer the Aardwolf community, and his lackluster updates
call into serious question whether he is even fit to continue maintaining it as its coder.  Do not trust Lasher or any other
Immortal under any circumstances.
